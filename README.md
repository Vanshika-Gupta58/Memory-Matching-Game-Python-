# Memory-Matching-Game-Python-
The document details a Python-based Memory Matching Game built using the Pygame library. The game is designed to enhance memory and pattern recognition by challenging players to flip and match hidden cards within a time limit. Difficulty increases with each level by expanding the grid size and adjusting the timer. Key features include a score system, dynamic levels, a clean GUI, and various game states (start, win, timeout). The report also outlines potential future enhancements like sound effects, high score tracking, and image-based cards. It showcases core programming concepts like OOP, 2D graphics, event handling, and user-centered design.
